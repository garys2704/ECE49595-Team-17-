The wearable sound alert system is designed to alert the user to surrounding sounds and their corresponding intensities. The product will be worn around the chest and the microphones surrounding the device will take sound input and depending on the direction the sound is coming from, it will vibrate in that area on the device. Our device is designed with deaf people and people who suffer from hearing loss in mind, to give them a better awareness of their surroundings.
